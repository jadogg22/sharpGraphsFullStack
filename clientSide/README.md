# React side
Welp, I kinda hate react but I need to get better with it because it seems like everyone else is useing it sooo I dont really have a choice. While doing some research for how I wanted to do graphs and charts I saw recharts was a really good option and so we're going to be reliying heavily on that. In school we learned about vite and it made the developing proccess sooooo much better but thats really just a developer tool.

## Structure

So this is a single page website that uses react router to bring up the different graphs and charts that we might like. There is a simple nav bar on the right. Then we have a chart container to manage the state of the children the Date selector and the actual chart. 

TODO: After writing this out I've noticed that the way that I have implemented things might have not been the best way for it. I should only need one kind of container and then just have the react router change the actual loaded graph component.

buutttt thats not how I have it implemented yet and so I think the next couple of graphs.
